Hello and wellcome to my GitHub portfolio!

I have a strong desire to build a career in Quality Assurance Software Testing field.

I made two online QA courses where I learned about Agile, manual testing, API testing using Postman, writing bug reports and test cases, automation testing using CypressJS and WebDriverIO and basic concepts of MySQL.

I'm always willing to learn, searching for new things so that I can develop myself. I consider myself optimistic, curious and I have a strong desire to learn new things.
